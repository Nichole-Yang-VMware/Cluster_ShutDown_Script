# Cluster_ShutDown_Script
This PowerShell script enables the powering on or off of a vSAN cluster, and is supported by PowerCLI 13.1.
The cmdlets Start-VsanCluster and Stop-VsanCluster were newly added to PowerCLI 13.1 and provide the same functionality.
This script serves as an additional sample for customers to utilize.
